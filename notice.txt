In the official version, users can generate various small fonts they need, and can also generate customized national standard level 1 and 2 Chinese character libraries.
0. Generate customized small fonts:
0. Use various adjustment functions of PCTOLCD to adjust the text style you need, such as font, word (underline, italic, bold), size (fonts of various dot matrix sizes, you can lock the dot matrix size itself (such as 16*16), and then adjust the text size within this fixed dot matrix size (for example, display 12*12 Chinese characters in the center of 16*16 dot matrix)
1. Collect the Chinese characters and symbols you need into a text file
2. Use the "Import Text" button
3. Confirm that "Generate Binary Font" is selected (it is recommended to select "Generate Index File" for reasons to be analyzed later)
4. Click the "Start Generation" button and select the generated font file name
5. Then wait patiently for a while (related to the size of the text to be processed). During this period, it is recommended not to move the keyboard and mouse.
6. The font is generated.

4. Wait patiently for a while to get the generated Chinese character library (the time depends on the specific machine).

Introduction to the structure of the generated Chinese character library
The Chinese character library used in this software adopts a structure similar to HZK16, that is, the dot matrix data of each Chinese character is arranged in the order of input Chinese characters. Take the generated 16*16 dot matrix Chinese character library as an example
16*16 dot matrix Chinese character library
The dot matrix size is 16*16, so each Chinese character dot matrix data occupies 32 bytes. If the user wants to use the dot matrix data in the generated 16*16 dot matrix small font library, the following algorithm can be used in the program:
0. Get the offset of the Chinese character in the generated font Chinese character list, that is, the record number HzNum of the Chinese character
1. *32 (HzNum*32) to get the offset address of the Chinese character dot matrix in the font library.
3. Starting from this offset address, read 32 bytes in the file continuously, which is the dot matrix information of the Chinese character.

In fact, the 16*16 dot matrix national standard Chinese character library generated by this software is arranged in area code, so it is the same as the standard HZK16
structure and can be used interchangeably.

For example, to generate a 24*48 dot matrix, regular, and tilted Chinese character library,
0. Since each Chinese character occupies 24*48/8= 144 bytes, so the user can first read the generated index list to find the record number of the Chinese character.
1. The record number * 144 will get the offset address of the Chinese character in the font.
2. Starting from this offset address, read 144 bytes in the font file continuously, which is the dot matrix information of the Chinese character.

For the use of other dot matrix Chinese character libraries, you can follow the same logic...

Of course, if you do not select the "Generate Binary Font" checkbox, the generated font will be a text format font data, and the method you use depends entirely on your needs.

The perfect version adds the function of generating English dot matrix fonts, and the method of use is the same as above.
